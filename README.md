# Factors Impacting Number of LinkedIn Job Applications per Post View
by JRLK - Jessie Ringness, Rebekah Kim, Laura Cai, Karen Dong

## Summary
Our project explores what influences the popularity of job postings on LinkedIn, using the number of job applications per post view. Our dataset includes variables such as job attributes, salary information, benefits, and company metrics and is scraped from LinkedIn in July 2023. We use data manipulation and linear regression for our final model. Key findings suggest no significant relationship between variables such as maximum salary, follower count, remote work availability, job experience level, and time posted with the percentage of viewers who applied. There are limitations in our project, including assumptions about salary normalization and outlier filtering, and improvements can include dealing with outliers and determining the threshold.
