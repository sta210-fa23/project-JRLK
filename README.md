# Factors Impacting Number of LinkedIn Job Applications per Post View
by JRLK - Jessie Ringness, Rebekah Kim, Laura Cai, Karen Dong

## Summary
Our project explores what influences the popularity of job postings on LinkedIn, using the number of job applications per post view. Our dataset includes variables such as applications, post views, maximum salary, listed time, follower count, remote work, experience level, and benefits of the job and is from a dataset created by Arsh Koneru-Ansari who scraped data from LinkedIn in August 2023. We use data manipulation, random sampling, multiple linear regression, and interaction effects for our final model. Key findings suggest that there is no significant relationship between our response variable, the percent of viewers who applied, and the maximum salary, number of followers,having a remote option, the job experience level, the hour at which it was posted, and if the benefits were posted so there is not strong evidence to support what makes a LinkedIn post have significant popularity. There are limitations in our project, including assumptions about salary normalization and outlier filtering, and improvements can include creating data subsets and filling in the NA values.
